As we can see on the source code, there is a system call for /bin/sh
we see that each time we put "auth " or "service" data is added to one of those two global variables by the program
we also see that when we type "login", the program check if some data is present in the memory after the auth variable address location
so we just have to type one time "auth " to initialize the auth variable and two times "service" to write some data at the desired address in memory
then "login" to get access to the shell
