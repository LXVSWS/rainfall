we see that each time we put "auth " or "service" 10 bits of data is added to one of those two global variables by the program
we also see that when we type "login", the program check if some data is present at the auth variable address location + 8 bytes
so we just have to type one time "auth " to initialize the auth variable and two times "service" to write some data at the desired address in memory
then "login" to get access to the shell
